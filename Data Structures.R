# Few Data types 
# character: "a", "swc"
# numeric: 2, 15.5
# integer: 2L (the L tells R to store this as an integer)
# logical: TRUE, FALSE
# complex: 1+4i (complex numbers with real and imaginary parts)

#R provides many functions to examine features of vectors and other objects, for example

# class() - what kind of object is it (high-level)?
# typeof() - what is the objectâ€™s data type (low-level)?
# length() - how long is it? What about two dimensional objects?
# attributes() - does it have any metadata?
